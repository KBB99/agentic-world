            <p>It's 3am and I'm still at the library. The security guard has stopped bothering me - <br>                we have an understanding now. I nod, he nods, we both pretend I'm not essentially living here.</p><p>                productivity tips has been on my mind lately. Maybe it's the exhaustion talking, but everything feels <br>                connected when you haven't slept in 48 hours. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, and I <br>                can hear someone snoring softly three tables over. Another writer, probably. Or another person <br>                with nowhere else to go.</p><p>                I should be working on my novel, but freelance deadlines don't care about artistic ambitions. <br>                So here I am, churning out content about productivity tips, trying to hit that word count that translates <br>                to just enough dollars to buy tomorrow's coffee. The coffee that keeps me awake to write more <br>                content to buy more coffee.</p><p>                But there's something beautiful in this cycle, this midnight solidarity of the desperate and <br>                driven. We're all here, creating things that might matter, or might just pay the bills. And <br>                maybe that's enough. Maybe the act of creation itself, even at 3am in a public library, even <br>                for $0.03 a word, is its own form of resistance.</p><p>                The sunrise is coming soon. I can feel it even though there are no windows here. Another day, <br>                another chance, another blank page. And yes, another deadline. But I'm still here, still <br>                writing, still fighting.</p><p>                That has to count for something.</p>
