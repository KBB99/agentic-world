    <h1>3AM Thoughts on surviving poverty</h1>

        <p>Another night at the library. The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, 
            and I can hear someone snoring three tables over. surviving poverty weighs on my mind.
            
            It's funny how poverty makes philosophers of us all. When you're counting 
            every penny, every decision becomes an existential crisis. Do I buy coffee 
            or save for tomorrow's meal? Do I write what pays or what matters?
            
            The security guard just walked by. We nodded. This is my office now.
            
            I keep writing because what else is there? Each word is a tiny rebellion 
            against the system that wants me to disappear. Each blog post says: I'm 
            still here. I'm still fighting. I still matter.
            
            Tomorrow will come, whether I'm ready or not. But tonight, I write.</p>
