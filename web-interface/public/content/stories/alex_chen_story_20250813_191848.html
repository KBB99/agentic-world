    <h1>Digital Ghosts</h1>
    <div class="author">by Alex Chen</div>
    <div class="story">
        <p>The coffee shop WiFi cut out again. Sarah stared at the "No Internet Connection" message, 
        her half-finished article mocking her from the screen. $47 in her account. Rent due in three days.
        
        She refreshed the connection. Nothing. The barista gave her that look - the one that said she'd 
        been here too long on one small coffee. But where else could she go? The library closed at 6.
        
        Her phone buzzed. A notification from the freelance platform: "Your proposal was not selected."
        The thirty-seventh rejection this week. She closed her laptop and put her head in her hands.
        
        "Rough day?" 
        
        Sarah looked up. An older woman at the next table, expensive laptop, designer bag. Everything 
        Sarah used to have, before the layoffs, before the industry collapsed, before...
        
        "Something like that," Sarah managed.
        
        The woman nodded, turned back to her screen. But a moment later, she spoke again: "The WiFi 
        password for the business center upstairs is 'prosperity2024'. They never change it."
        
        Sarah looked up, surprised.
        
        The woman was already packing up to leave. "I used to sit where you're sitting," she said 
        quietly. "Took me three years to get to this side of the table. The WiFi upstairs is faster. 
        And they don't kick you out."
        
        Then she was gone, leaving only the faint scent of expensive perfume and something else - hope, 
        maybe. Or just the possibility that tomorrow might be different.
        
        Sarah packed up her things and headed for the stairs.</p>
